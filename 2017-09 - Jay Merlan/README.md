# Seattle Dynamo User Group September 2017

## Summary
The samples included in this folder were used in the presentation by Jay Merlan at the SeaDUG meetup for September 2017. These sample files use the BIMxDB and BIMxHTML custom nodes to create bar and pie charts using the Google Charts API. Ultimately, the final product could be a dashboard using the Twitter Bootstrap framework.
