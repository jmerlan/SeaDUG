# Create Sheet Set Based on a Parameter Value

## Summary
This graph was shared at the first Seattle Dynamo User Group on April 5, 2017.

Although a bit sloppy, this graph will help you create a sheet set (for printing from Revit) using Python. For a full write-up, visit my blog post: http://bimextension.com/drawing-lists-in-revit-rather-than-excel/

## Disclaimer
I have always intended to clean this up to make it more user-friendly but haven't had time. If you would like to contribute a cleaned up version, please make a pull request on GitHub: https://github.com/jmerlan/SeaDUG
